    Welcome to the lecture 10 and the final lecture
in the R module of the course data science
    for engineers. In the previous lectures we
have seen; what are the basic data types that
    are supported by R, how to write scripts,
how to write functions and how to do control
    structures, how to do programming and so on.
In this lecture we are going to show you how
    to generate some basic graphics; such as scatter
plot, line plot and bar plot using R, and
    we will also give a brief idea on why there
is a need for more sophisticated graphics
    and how R does it.
First we will consider scatter plot; scatter
    plot is one of the most widely used plots
where we have some independent variable and
    dependent variable, when you want to see how
a dependent variable is dependent on the independent
    variable. We can use scatter plot generating
the scatter plot in R, is quite simple. The
    first command here shows, it is creating a
vector which is having the elements from 1
    to 10, and the next command here takes this
x and calculates the element wise square of
    the x and then assign it to value y.
When you plot y it will generate this plot
    here . Since we havent specified what is x
which is independent variable, the R generates
    its own independent variable as the index,
since this vector contains 10 elements. It
    will create the index based on the number
of elements in the vector and then the y values
    which are the squares of elements 1 to 10
that are 1 4 9 and so on are shown in the
    y axis, and 10 square is 100. We have the
final value here on the y axis as 100.
    So, let us illustrate the scatter plot using
some inbuilt data set; that is available in
    R. So, we are talking about a data set by
name empty cars. So, you can access this data
    set by just typing empty cars. This data set
is a data frame which contains 32 observations
    on 11 variables. The variables are listed
here such as number of cylinders, which is
    represented by variable c y l and m p g. What
is the ah mileage that this cars gives; that
    is miles per us gallon and weight w t, which
is weight of the car and so on.
    Now, let us try to plot a scatter plot between
weight and m p g of this data frame . To do
    that what we need to use, is plot command.
This is your independent variable car weight,
    this is your dependent variable miles per
gallon and this main helps in naming the title
    of the graph x lab to give a label for x axis,
y lab is used to give a label for y axis and
    the this p c h corresponds to different shapes
for points, and this p c h is equal to 19
    corresponds to the shape that is shown in
this screen. You can use different p c h values
    to obtain different shapes for the points
in a scatter plot .
    Next we move the line plot. You can take same
example what we have seen earlier. If the
    same plot command can be used what you need
to do to generate a line plot, is to specify
    an extra argument type which is l.
So, type is equal to l generates a line, instead
    of the scatter plot. Next we move on to the
bar plot, the syntax to generate bar plot
    in R is as follows; bar plot of h. These are
the heights which can be a vector or matrices
    to keep it simple. We will deal with only
vectors and names dot argument. What this
    ah argument does is? it will print the names
under the each attribute in the H x lab and
    y lab, and main has a same meanings as what
we have seen for the scatterplot, and colour
    gives us an option to give colour to the bar
plot. This is the R code that can be used
    to generate the bar plot. I want to define
h heights of the barcodes as a vector, which
    is having the values 7 12 28 3 and 41, and
I want to create another vector which is of
    character variable, which is having the values
March, April, May, June and July, and now
    I am trying to create a bar plot with h as
heights and name start arguments as m x lab
    as month, y lab as revenue and the colour
of the bar notes I want, is blue and the title
    is revenue chart and the border is red.
So, when you execute these commands, this
    is how the bar plot looks. These are the heights
of the bar charts, this is a 3 ok. And then
    in the names dot variable we have March, April,
May, June and July, which is printed at the
    bottom of each height, and the x axis is month,
y axis is revenue and the title is revenue
    chart.
Now, let us see why there is a need for sophisticated
    graphics. Let us say there is a need for you
to show multiple plots in a single figure
    as shown below. How do you do this?
What are the challenges that you face when
    you want to create figure that was shown in
the earlier slide. So, the exact figure can
    be reproduced using this code which is shown
here for this.
    What you have to know, is you have know where
to introduce for loop, which columns of data
    frame to be selected for plotting, and you
have to also position each graph in the grid
    etcetera. Even though you do all of this operations,
the visuals are less pleasing that is where
    we need more sophisticated graphics packages
in R . This is where the g g plot two comes
    into picture. The g g plot two provides a
very beautiful package for generating graphics
    in R in this course, we have not deal much
with g g plot.
    In summary, we have seen how to generate scatter
plots, line plots and bar plots in the R.
    We have also seen the challenges and disadvantages
of basic graphics and the need for using the
    advanced packages; such as g g plot two for
generating beautiful graphics in R. With this
    we end the R module for this course. Wish
you all the best for the next modules in this
    course.
Thank you
