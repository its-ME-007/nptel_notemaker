Welcome to the lecture 2 in the R model of
    the course Data science for Engineers in the
previous lecture we have given a brief introduction
    about R and R studio and we have seen how
to create an R file write some codes in R
    file and how to execute an R file.
In this lecture we are going to show how to
    add comments to the R file, how to clear the
environment and how to save the workspace
    of R now let us first look at how to add comments
to the R file.
    Before that let us ask this question why do
you add comments to your codes? Adding comments
    improve the readability of your code for example,
you can explain the purpose of the code you
    are writing in the comments or you can explain
what an algorithm is doing to accomplish the
    purpose which you are attempting at. Writing
comments also help us to generate documentation
    which is external to the source code itself
by documentation generators.
    Let us look how to add comments to a single
line in R script first you can comment a single
    line R by using hash key at the start of the
comment if you see in this example I have
    commented this first comment by a hash key
which turns this command green and if you
    notice these commands are describing what
this program is doing, what it is doing is
    it is taking a single number and then calculating
a value which is 10 times of it.
    So, you can see here I am defining a variable
a is equal to 10 which I am commenting it
    out as the input number and now I am explaining
this operation which is being happened here
    which is b is calculated as 10 times a and
if you would have remembered in the previous
    lecture we have used this symbol for assigning
a value to a variable you can also use equal
    to in R studio that is been demonstrated here.
Now you can see how commenting makes your
    script file more readable.
Comments can also be used to make certain
    lines of code in at you can do that by inserting
a hash key at the beginning of the line like
    here you can see I want to comment this ah
line which says a is equal to 14 if I wish
    to do so, I can comment it by keeping a hash
key in front of it. Now we will see how to
    add comments to multiple lines at once in
R.
    There are 2 ways first we used to select the
multiple lines which you want to comment using
    the cursor and then use the key combination
control plus shift plus C to comment or uncomment
    the selected lines.
the other way is to use the GUI, select the
    lines which you want to comment by using cursor
and in the code menu if you click on the code
    menu a pop up window pops out in which we
need to select comment or uncomment lines
    which appropriately comments or uncomment
the lines which you have selected. In some
    cases when you run the codes using source
and source with echo your console will become
    messy.
And it is needed to clear the console let
    us now look at how to clear the console. The
console can be cleared using the shortcut
    key control plus L, let us look at an example,
in this code I have defined a and calculated
    b and printed a comma b, when I execute this
code using source with echo all the commands
    will get printed here. Now, let us say suppose
I want to clear this console what I have to
    do is I have to click here and I have to enter
the key combination control plus L . Once
    I do this you can see that the console will
get cleared remember clearing console will
    not delete the variables that are there in
the workspace you can see that even though
    we have cleared the console in the workspace
we still have the variables that are created
    earlier.
Now, let us see how to clear the variables
    from the R environment you can clear the variables
on the R environment using rm command, when
    you want to clear a single variable from the
R environment you can use the rm function
    has shown here rm followed by the variable
you want to remove. If you want to delete
    all the variables that are there in the environment
what you can do is you can use the rm with
    an argument list is equal to ls followed by
parenthesis or you can clear all the variables
    in the environment using the GUI in the environment
history pane you see this brush button, when
    you press the brush button it will pop up.
A windows saying we want to clear all the
    objects that are available in environment
if you say yes it will clear all the variables.
    Which is shown there and you can see the environment
is empty now. Now, let us see how to save.
    The data from the workspace in R I have already
mentioned that the information that is saved
    in the environment of R is temporary and it
is not retain when you close the R session
    or restart the R Studio it is sometimes needed
to save the data which is already there in
    the current session.
The reason being you would have done certain
    operations to get the data to this form and
you do not want to repeat those actions and
    you need to start from the point where you
want to leave now, in that cases you need
    to save the data from the R environment when
you want to do that.
    There are 2 ways the first one is the automatic
option when you close the R Studio application
    it will ask you look do you want to save the
workspace image if you say yes it will save
    all the variables that are there in the workspace,
if you say do not save the R Studio will exit
    and the workspace information not be saved.
You can also save the workspace information
    using manual method where you can save the
information to a file using the save command
    and the saved information can be reloaded
for the future sessions using the load command
    let us see how to do that in R. Here is an
example code the first line here shows how
    to save a variable that is there in the workspace
into a file name sess1 dot R data.
    . So, in the comments you can see that this
is the command which you can use to save a
    single variable a, if you are willing to say
the full workspace you need to use this command
    save list is equal to ls with argument all
dot names is equal to true and you can give
    the filename whatever you wish to and the
shortcut key for this command which is given
    here is save dot image which saves the data
in the environment into dot R data file in
    the current working directory. Once you do
that you can load the workspace information
    at later point of time whenever you want using
this command load you can specify the file
    is equal to the file name which you save the
data into.
    So, in this lecture we have seen how to add
comments to R file, how to clear the console
    and how to clear the R objects that are there
in the environment and also we have seen how
    to save the variables that are available in
the R environment for further use. In the
    next lecture we are going to introduce you
to the basic data types of R.
    Thank you .
