Welcome to the course on data science for
    engineers.
In this module, we are going to introduce
    R as a programming language to perform data
analysis.
This lecture, we are going to give a brief
    introduction about R and Studio.
In R studio, we are going to look how to set
    the working directory, how to create an R
file and save it, how to execute an R file
    and how to execute pieces of R code.
Let us first see what is R. R is an open source
    programming language that is widely used as
a statistical software and data analysis tool.
R generally comes with the Command line interface.
R is available across widely used platforms,
    windows, line x and macOS Now, let us see,
what is R Studio.
R Studio is an integrated development environment
    for R. Integrated development environment,
is a GUI, where you can write your quotes,
    see the results and also see the variables
that are generated during the course of programming.
R Studio is available as both Open source
    and Commercial software.
R Studio is also available as both Desktop
    version and Server version.
For this course, we are going to use Open
    Source Desktop Edition so, that you can solve
your assignments using this R Studio.
R Studio is also available for various platforms,
    such as windows, line x and macOS.
Now, let us see, how an R Studio looks, when
    you first run application.
This is how an R Studio Interface looks.
When you first run the application, to the
    left, we see Console panel, where you can
type in the comments and see the results that
    are generated when you type in the commands.
To the top right, you have Environmental History
    pane.
It contains 2 types: the Environment type,
    where, it shows the variables that are generated
during the course of programming, in a workspace,
    which is temporary and in the History tab,
you will see all the commands that are used
    till now from the beginning of usage of R
Studio.
The right bottom, you have another panel,
    which contains multiple tab, such as files,
plots, packages and help.
The Files tab, shows the files and directories
    that are available in the default workspace
of R. The Plots tab, shows the plots that
    are generated during the course of programming.
And the Packages tab helps you to look, what
    are the packages that are already installed
in the R Studio and it also gives, an user
    interface, to install new packages.
The Help tab, is a most important one, where
    you can get help from the R Documentation
on the functions that are in built in R. The
    final and last tab is the Viewer tab, which
can be used to see the local web content that
    is generated using R, are some other application.
For this course, you are not going to use
    this tab from much.
So, we limit ourself not discuss more about
    that, viewer tab.
So, we have got an idea about how R Studio
    looks.
Let us see, how to set the working directory
    in R Studio.
The working directory in R Studio can be set
    in 2 ways.
The first, way is to use the console and using
    the command Set working directory.
You can use this function Set working directory
    and give the path of the directory which u
want to be the working directory for r studio,
    in the double codes.
R, to set the working directory from the GUI,
    you need to click on this 3 dots button.
When you click this, this will open up a file
    browser, which will help you to choose your
working directory.
Once you choose your working directory, you
    need to use this setting button in the more
tab and click it and then you get a popup
    menu, where you need to select Set as working
directory.
This will select the current directory, which
    you have chosen using this file browser as
your working directory.
Once you set the working directory, you are
    ready to program in R Studio.
Let us illustrate how to create an R file
    and write some code.
To create an R file, there are 2 ways: The
    first way is: you can click on the file tab,
from there when you when you click it will
    give a drop down menu, where you can select
new file and then R script, so that, you will
    get a new file open.
The other way is to use the plus button, that
    is just below the file tab and you can choose
R script, from there, to open a new R script
    file.
Once you open an R script file, this is how
    an R Studio with the script file open looks
like.
So, 3 panels console environmental history
    and files and plots panels are there.
On top of that, you have a new window, which
    is now being opened as a script file.
Now you are ready to write a script file or
    some program in R Studio.
So, let us illustrate this with a small example,
    where I am assigning a value of 11 to a, in
the first line of the code which I have written
    and you have b which is a times 10, that is
the second command, I am evaluating the value
    of a times 10 and assign the value to the
b and the third statement, which is print
    c of a, b concatenates this a and b and print
the result.
So, this is how you write a script file in
    R. Once you write a script file, you have
to save this file before you execute it.
Let us see, how to save the R file.
From the file menu, if you click the file
    tab, you can either save the file, when you
want to save the file, if you click the save
    button, it will automatically save the file
has untitled x.
So, this x can be 1 or 2 depending upon how
    many R scripts you have already opened, or
it is a nice idea, to use the Save as button,
    just below the Save one, so that, you can
rename the script file according to your wish.
Let us suppose we have click the, Save as
    button.
This will pop out a window like this, where
    you can rename the script file as test R,
are the one which you are intended to.
Once you rename, you can say save, that will
    save the script file.
So now, we have seen how to open an R script
    and how to write some code in the R script
file.
The next task is to execute the R file.
There are seven ways, you can execute the
    commands that are available in the R file.
The first way is to use run command.
This run command, can be executed using the
    GUI, by pressing the run button there, or
you can use the Shortcut key, this is control
    plus enter, what it does is, it will execute
the line in which the cursor is there.
The other way is to run the R code 'R' using
    source R source with echo.
The difference between source and source with
    echo is the following: The Source command
executes the whole R file and only prints
    the output, which you wanted to print.
Whereas, source with echo prints the commands
    also, along with the output you are printing.
So, this is an example, where I have executed
    the R file, using the source with echo, you
can see, in the console, that it printed a
    the command a equal to 11 and the command
b is equal to a time 10 and also the output
    print c of a, b with the values.
So, a is 11 and b is 11 times 10, this is
    110.
So, this is how, the output will be printed
    in console.
So, that is the result.
Now, let us see how to execute the pieces
    of code in R. As you have seen earlier, you
can use run command, to run the single line,
    right.
So now, let us try to assign value 14 for
    a and then try to run it.
So, how do you do this?
Take your cursor to the line, which you want
    to edit, replace that 11 by 14 and then use
control enter or the run button.
This will execute only the line, where the
    cursor is placed.
In the Environment pane, you can see that,
    only value of a, has been changed and the
b value remains same.
This is because, we have executed only the
    line 2 of the code, which change the value
of a, but we have not executed the code of
    line 3.
So, the b value reminds as is.
Value of a, has changed, but not the value
    of b.
In summary, we can say that, Run can be used
    to execute the selected lines of R code.
Source and Source with echo can be used to
    run the whole file.
The advantage of using Run is, you can troubleshoot
    or debug the program when something is not
behaving according to your expectations.
The disadvantages of using run command is,
    it populates the console and make it messy
unnecessarily.
In the next lecture, we are going to see how
    to add comments to the R file and how to add
comments to the single line and multiple lines
    etc.
Thank you .
